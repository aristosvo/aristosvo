I'm Aris, a DevOps kinda guy who likes to code and optimize.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [🥁 aztfmove 🥁](https://github.com/aristosvo/aztfmove), my new tool to move Azure resources already specified in Terraform to new resource groups or subscriptions
- 💬 Ask me about Terraform, Azure, Observability, IaC 🔥🔥
